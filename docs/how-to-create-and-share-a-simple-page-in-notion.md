## How to Create and Share a Simple Page in Notion

The first step in leveraging Notion for your information sharing needs is to create a dedicated page. Notion makes this process intuitive, allowing you to quickly add new pages directly from your workspace sidebar. These new pages are instantly accessible and ready for content.

## Creating and Naming Your New Notion Page

The first step in leveraging Notion for your information sharing needs is to create a dedicated page. Notion makes this process intuitive, allowing you to quickly add new pages directly from your workspace sidebar. These new pages are instantly accessible and ready for content.

### Step 1: Initiate a New Page Creation

To start, navigate to the Notion sidebar on the left side of your screen. Look for the **Private** section, which typically houses your personal pages and documents. Within this section, you'll find a **+ New page** button.

![Notion sidebar with '+ New page' button highlighted under the 'Private' section](https://d14xczjzvlshjn.cloudfront.net/screencasts/scrcst_mfwodyu0prfkiqml/processed/article_images/article-article_2xyj4onltpmvmigu-0-ce9f6645-affa-4753-adfc-c2b04bfb55c2.jpg?Expires=1797767819&Signature=dXYmXzo15Wn01kKbDH6wN20PrkxkVO7BQlsdHtwNDR8~pFujPuc7NDw2x-gB-JaqVGBu7Y77cOsnwPE5yNAsQMR9GFhKXqryZm2chOK6xnhcYTvTbhQfTgJePCQJowmtxz0pm4jkyuhXQhhQd2-C1mibxjQ2DcDRdvPTb3L2eEGO9PC7mfd0r5CK1iPmPSMDuYCnG0LmHWqZYGXaRxLyLQfR95j8B7V2K1cxFR8t58L5qVNFQ9pCIYA3iJ0RyW74osVFIkhOp3ZMwNik6kixU0vLY8gkKfX0EqRQZrzfWLgrnJFhYzJv65IhPpw9CZOjDi-EquOJ0OGiBCU585KvGg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKA26BID7YIZU7LYRQT)

Click the **+ New page** button. This action immediately creates a new page entry within the **Private** section of your sidebar. The entry will initially be labeled "New page" and will be highlighted, indicating that it is ready for you to input a title.

### Step 2: Title Your New Page

Once the "New page" entry is highlighted, the cursor will automatically be positioned for text input. Enter a descriptive title for your page. This title will serve as the primary identifier for your page both in the sidebar and within the page itself.

In this example, we'll title the page _New page_.

![Highlighted 'New page' entry in the sidebar with 'New page' typed as the title](https://d14xczjzvlshjn.cloudfront.net/screencasts/scrcst_mfwodyu0prfkiqml/processed/article_images/article-article_2xyj4onltpmvmigu-3-4c3e13d4-1746-4d35-b50e-87813646d7e3.jpg?Expires=1797767819&Signature=c268mYvcYk16lOUOpKy~rMbImaidb~Fk2mb~kspbbFpTr5LqscquWHgL5hVm0GhECTwIAVESGcQqZoYRbjooMF4s20QwNvuvarDW~St-q-eIvdUxQQnAFuWs7K~UkGS4G1zr3QvuYe0HtHvfMKHYkGQQDo5yvyW7VSFN8A8JchU~UaSsfL6xUEProgLzTlIlSgu-yvfJzcKdw827Dx5YHrW~kTCF-khMuvlP71pptISW-Epsrj2N~Ia3Sdz6Jo5p8uvfapIqpm-dGWEL5o3fSX7qa6Szubnla3I5bfw98I1e6C0L2f6HONtYuEJyHx7~3jmeKniqolC4pvjxzKPTWg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKA26BID7YIZU7LYRQT)

After typing your desired title, press **Enter** or click anywhere outside the title field to confirm the name. The page title is now saved, and the page is listed in your sidebar under its new name.

> [!TIP]
> Press **Enter** to accept the title quickly after typing, or click outside the field to confirm. This helps keep your workflow fast and focused.

## Adding Content to Your Notion Page

With your page created and titled, the next crucial step is to add meaningful content. Notion offers a blank canvas for each new page, inviting you to populate it with text, images, databases, and more. For this tutorial, we will focus on adding simple text content to get you started.

### Step 1: Open the Page for Editing

After naming your page in the sidebar, you'll notice that the page content area on the right side of the screen still displays a default "New page" view. To begin adding content to the newly named page, you need to explicitly open it in the main content area.

In the left sidebar, locate your newly created page entry (e.g., "**New page**"). Click on this entry in the sidebar.

![Sidebar with the newly titled 'New page' entry highlighted, and the main content area showing a fresh page](https://d14xczjzvlshjn.cloudfront.net/screencasts/scrcst_mfwodyu0prfkiqml/processed/article_images/article-article_2xyj4onltpmvmigu-9-014df36a-425f-4dcb-b84d-b3ad79d79050.jpg?Expires=1797767819&Signature=jMnybhqvsXza0CiQkt6E0DOAGZu8s83nIFBunkMlRvGwQDaKKljzZjy8T1CbDwpZlEBaLiDsqTdomJVOpf1InuuDxN84LsU0J3IlRcmv7cf~6aA8Y3gCrIqXMKoyWGwdZwLcGnJY~3fmkbmkBH7BzKikuAFji2-kmhKh3iIxS08KVvAYBmT2VGnLxQXmgRucUF1FPcvy9~EUXyAN5JpjaAXIjfU~taJTDy2xNcBn9avgETJDxeiVM1uqXnRJ9cy5wd1HQBtEtGDU9wjpSsTGSRWNOLOM9iwGsw8kgVJLZKFRu99nW1RPBi9g8uNnXQnXmQla4j~bTAGONvnkQKfjCg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKA26BID7YIZU7LYRQT)

Upon clicking the page title in the sidebar, the main content area on the right will update to display your newly created page. At the top of this content area, your page's title (e.g., "New page") will be prominently displayed. Below it, you'll see fields for **Created**, **Tags**, and **URL**, along with an empty area for comments and the main page body.

> [!NOTE]
> When you click the page title in the sidebar, the main content area updates to show the page properties like **Created**, **Tags**, and **URL**, which can help with organization and metadata.

### Step 2: Focus on the Page Body

Below the page properties (like **Tags** and **URL**), you'll see a prompt that says "Press Enter to continue with an empty page, or create a template." This is your cue to begin adding content. The main page body area is where all your page content will reside.

Click anywhere within the empty page body area, specifically where the prompt "Press Enter to continue..." is displayed.

![Main page content area with the text \"Press Enter to continue with an empty page, or create a template\" visible, indicating the body focus area](https://d14xczjzvlshjn.cloudfront.net/screencasts/scrcst_mfwodyu0prfkiqml/processed/article_images/article-article_2xyj4onltpmvmigu-10-e8d1630b-89c2-4394-82da-42c66c511130.jpg?Expires=1797767819&Signature=KqOySj-vrrEpoVYgq7zgxn33jmYehJdLZOez2QB1smKNDw4BY6Iq7IF6gMI9tmD1quyvjHhh0p3jMZeoVIUYV8ljLb8K-4Ymmk0X10LYnb6Oc3BQO2VLKN1bSVXbE0Da3F0LV9jfdPNAJxsZGXOZweInIWt4tzhk3pXHmddZLEO~~y5ZVhWEYSv~0dCk8H8hNW5iUuAqPILvQoTsJpDUR0VcvkTFfEeFq1hH0Vtossjzxbz4PDzJse54gY4t7bxlvubmRlv8w5OqNUNSedS0izlYyYw7eDcZ6luvl0DR8fWs7SgfdX2S7djSiRaxraqbdsqo7ilvDLDkpmAvcis8uA__&Key-Pair-Id=APKA26BID7YIZU7LYRQT)

Once you click, the prompt will change to "Write, press 'space' for AI, or '/' for commands...", and a blinking cursor will appear. This indicates that the page body is now active and ready for text input.

### Step 3: Enter Your Page Content

With the cursor active in the page body, you can now start typing your desired content. For this tutorial, we'll keep it simple by adding a basic sentence.

Type _Writing something here_ into the page body.

![Page body with the text \"Writing something here\" entered](https://d14xczjzvlshjn.cloudfront.net/screencasts/scrcst_mfwodyu0prfkiqml/processed/article_images/article-article_2xyj4onltpmvmigu-13-2161ff6b-ae2e-4f15-aa14-e41e40972715.jpg?Expires=1797767819&Signature=HAhTRYHqeFlfc-WU6AflO~eA~r85EbXntDm3p9KAoLjo679v-AXGHbbSTFD5CIkL5y-GGiyts3XX1n7MEW2ARlejdcZt05zwxYzvZLgYaMARK4Z0fxiO6-bCrD4wuVQbLPUSOiKyPD-LV9AExHk5rlAtb5WrrEPaW1nt6C3~Dhk8sqU5wl2K07H67Mi7prvKck1Ggu2PmlISzfEpOPoVF6UbKwqIvwcG2SJ7Y~Jue7DYK355PdibvRwj5Mu1rsx739b3No2bninZPxDXsn~yV9UHaE4KPe3xpWE87qpZ7CR7MamwOBfR2~BriJ4DBTtzfLH64HQUa~a9GA3~MFNXpA__&Key-Pair-Id=APKA26BID7YIZU7LYRQT)

As you type, Notion automatically saves your work. The text you enter will become the main content of your page. You can add more text, create headings, lists, or even embed other Notion blocks by typing `/` to access commands.

> [!TIP]
> Use `/` to insert blocks like headings, lists, images, and embeds quickly—it's the fastest way to build richer pages.

## Sharing Your Notion Page with Others

One of Notion's most powerful features is the ability to easily share your pages with others, allowing for seamless collaboration or public distribution. You can generate a direct link to your page, making it accessible to anyone you choose to share it with.

### Step 1: Access the Share Dialog

Once your page has a title and some content, you're ready to share it. The **Share** button is consistently located in the top-right corner of every Notion page, making it easily accessible whenever you need to distribute your work.

Look for the **Share** button at the very top-right of your Notion page.

![Top-right corner of the Notion page with the 'Share' button highlighted](https://d14xczjzvlshjn.cloudfront.net/screencasts/scrcst_mfwodyu0prfkiqml/processed/article_images/article-article_2xyj4onltpmvmigu-15-daf3098d-3fbf-40ce-8de9-82f7d35a771a.jpg?Expires=1797767819&Signature=RzUvwJXMS3qTFXEzaw-2LWObRo~8Kx8veU6HKJly~AsqYJTcGiyd6y5Tu~Ok5dv5t1mzKZlLI4yociMp9bPabVOfkjrcmUMbJbjLr9mFFwLJ8cPPNNADbzp0HdKSGE0xG1NsVXtmsb7EKlnUeTbdjCceoYRJKKB4LcBS6dn0che4hw3fMWAINFIrdvbPib2wYvWqgvC6yV9U2AgskEAE9KsKBgUaViPkrpqvIsPt50hfyogAc4PK2tYj55iqnD6cOEK7FivcHmvu-Abwez64LLsCoaSFQX6B7pgWnRe0go3ZThnMcYXeJzHQFLOOn~izE6pdhcyQMXoaW6e8R2weQw__&Key-Pair-Id=APKA26BID7YIZU7LYRQT)

Click the **Share** button. A "Share" dialog box will appear, overlaying your current page content. This dialog offers various sharing options, including inviting specific people via email, managing general access, and publishing the page to the web.

The dialog also presents two tabs at the top: **Share** and **Publish**. By default, the **Share** tab is active, focusing on direct collaboration. Below these tabs, you'll see an input field labeled "Email or group, separated by commas" where you can invite specific users, along with their current access levels listed below.

> [!NOTE]
> The "Share" dialog contains both **Share** and **Publish** tabs—use **Share** for direct collaboration and **Publish** when you want to make the page public on the web.

### Step 2: Copy the Shareable Link

Within the "Share" dialog, your primary goal is to obtain a public link to your page. This link will grant view access to anyone who has it, without requiring them to be Notion users or part of your workspace, depending on your general access settings.

In the bottom-right corner of the "Share" dialog, locate the **Copy link** button.

![Share dialog box open, with the 'Copy link' button highlighted at the bottom right](https://d14xczjzvlshjn.cloudfront.net/screencasts/scrcst_mfwodyu0prfkiqml/processed/article_images/article-article_2xyj4onltpmvmigu-17-5fdea1f4-2c69-4985-8c7a-65b9befce7b3.jpg?Expires=1797767819&Signature=Mx3zswhTEGHL3y3U~r1RRI1dlshH1j8jtJlJGdUFlN6wPKCZpKR55U7g3lv5sjdMUhEKksly21PSF57STHvxd1bqG8du4SYzWrwzdd0Nf1bxddpCyjh9F8185yN3Oip0YevvjvzcEzk430oT59pkI-ZZf1ApzfSc7~DmelC6f529pLrygkyLpLgSv63B1g1PsuPc-2S~FlTi9tbQVTS6TovHOk3Y3fwYJUG3T2wdnBBQmy0B-8QhrMK6TnB5hTj-bHkkLt0AhLQ5W9Id9qWOpDm-Mdot2yyCSgxI10EMYhQWthfshmRqZHQhRsIL3ypRe1q-833sdP0h~TC9ziGorw__&Key-Pair-Id=APKA26BID7YIZU7LYRQT)

Click the **Copy link** button.

Upon clicking, a small, temporary "confirmation toast" message will appear at the bottom-center of your screen, stating "Copied link to clipboard." This message confirms that the public URL of your Notion page has been successfully copied to your system's clipboard. You can now paste this link into emails, chat applications, or any other communication medium.

![Share dialog still open, with the 'Copied link to clipboard' confirmation toast visible at the bottom of the screen](https://d14xczjzvlshjn.cloudfront.net/screencasts/scrcst_mfwodyu0prfkiqml/processed/article_images/article-article_2xyj4onltpmvmigu-19-4e75f2df-717d-4732-9b74-07c2f7498deb.jpg?Expires=1797767819&Signature=X36TAFlM8MrENRpOrgXuGlxYtNBJNc0uaJvBbZz9ceMEbn6U2uGD9Jv3HQ15twF32Z4jdnUr1u9P5sWWbx1qykjVM-TyBffoJ6ESEIdElZGfWTFQFSCQq43VKjY3Of~-aTZqbTgKNb0hTycyFbymSLw7i5invLhtnfJu4bCLUp2UChYMEs8JOT7Bh~wOXsWV7DTSI4KeBX90zx6l0G4eK0mQvI4DDTWUGUz~sjgrlPmLXNa9XY6vjxf3uCJAPCARO0nfVwogUT8jGPQ7RUlm8wXyXA9sBjcqJlRQuhABjRl~~peOb8HMUKx0aXXTfrxgd1al0B1acuqMaaspvaS1gg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKA26BID7YIZU7LYRQT)

> [!TIP]
> Best practice: Before sharing a public link, double-check your page's content for any sensitive information. You can manage the "General access" settings in the share dialog to restrict who can access the link (e.g., "Only people invited" or "Anyone with link").

> [!WARNING]
> If you change "General access" from "Anyone with link" to "Only people invited," previously copied links will no longer grant access to users who aren't invited.

### Step 3: Dismiss the Share Dialog

After copying the link, you can close the "Share" dialog and return to your page.

Click anywhere on the dark, semi-transparent background area outside the "Share" dialog.

![Notion page with the 'Share' dialog open. A green ring highlights clicking the page background to dismiss the dialog.](https://d14xczjzvlshjn.cloudfront.net/screencasts/scrcst_mfwodyu0prfkiqml/processed/article_images/article-article_2xyj4onltpmvmigu-20-1e8fb3ce-4ed2-4e21-bc9b-d2bc54b0c9c4.jpg?Expires=1797767819&Signature=SueadDi~lNTHJu7HDg8L8Cup97CrOlLFX5UTFzEqOUZLABTgBMl9DjQvIN5dLYkjYtPosKjhrR3MkrV4~1hjpO6T8pYM3vnEqjvSjrW29PCSC92n3rnua6VOkNbgKO815GN5V-BYEw7yV45-nrs4PFLcAmAOo0pGudhHqRTn98eCn5DSkG6Gy2bfPR7ciBgLcdlLP5EprwmZFcqgOHpii8YV-4iVnIPVIRXSk0EnLWwLa36ki0Er237MO4VSj2zGRscQFG7a-Vi3rhCr0d3WnkJLHI1IyBxCS9YZd05op9ZGMvZ1r6AMlTJSB5V6jiDInDedCYPU0hwLICFMm~8NBA__&Key-Pair-Id=APKA26BID7YIZU7LYRQT)

Clicking outside the dialog will dismiss it, returning you to the full view of your Notion page. The link remains on your clipboard, ready to be pasted wherever you need it.

## FAQ

- **Can I restrict access to a page even after copying the link?**
Yes. You can always go back to the **Share** dialog and adjust the "General access" settings. If you change it from "Anyone with link" to "Only people invited," the copied link will no longer grant access to unauthorized users.
- **What happens if I rename the page after sharing the link?**
Renaming a Notion page generally does not break the shared link. Notion automatically updates the URL path to reflect the new title, but the core page ID remains the same, ensuring the link continues to function.
- **Can I embed this Notion page into another website?**
Yes. Notion pages can often be embedded into other websites or applications using Notion's embed block or by leveraging certain integrations. This option is typically found within the **Publish** tab of the **Share** dialog.
