> **TL;DR:** To report an issue on GitHub, navigate to your repository's **Issues** tab, click **New issue**, fill in the issue title and a detailed description, then click **Create issue** to submit it.

## Reporting an issue on GitHub: a step-by-step guide

Encountering a bug, proposing a new feature, or tracking a task within a project can be streamlined and effectively managed through GitHub's issue tracking system. Reporting issues correctly ensures that project maintainers receive all the necessary information to understand, reproduce, and resolve problems efficiently. A well-documented issue saves time, reduces miscommunication, and helps maintain a clear development roadmap.

This guide will walk you through the process of creating and submitting a new issue on GitHub. You'll learn how to navigate to the issues section of a repository, complete the issue form with a clear title and description, and successfully submit your report for review. By the end, you'll be equipped to contribute to projects by accurately documenting any problems or requests you have.

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- An active GitHub account.
- Access to the GitHub repository where you intend to report an issue.

## Understanding GitHub issues

GitHub Issues serve as a central hub for tracking improvements, tasks, bugs, and other work for a project. They provide a structured way to manage discussions, assign responsibilities, and keep a history of changes related to specific problems or features. Every issue has a unique number and can be commented on, assigned to users, labeled, and linked to milestones and projects.

### The anatomy of a GitHub repository

When you first navigate to a GitHub repository, you'll typically land on the **Code** tab. This view provides an overview of the project's files, folders, and recent commit history. Above the file list, a navigation bar presents several key tabs, including **Code**, **Issues**, **Pull requests**, **Actions**, **Projects**, **Security**, **Insights**, and **Settings**. Each tab serves a distinct purpose in managing the repository.

## Navigating to the issues section

The first step in reporting an issue is to access the dedicated **Issues** section of your chosen GitHub repository. This area lists all open and closed issues, allowing you to browse existing reports or create a new one.

### Step 1: Click the issues tab

From the repository's main page (typically the **Code** tab), locate the primary navigation bar directly below the repository name. Click the **Issues** tab to switch to the issue tracking interface. This tab is usually positioned to the right of the **Code** tab.

Upon clicking, the page will reload, displaying the **Issues** view. Here, you'll see a list of all issues associated with the repository, filtered by default to show "Open" issues. If there are no open issues, you'll see a message stating "No results" with an option to adjust your search filters.

> [!NOTE]
> The number next to the **Issues** tab (e.g., **Issues 1**) indicates the total count of open issues in the repository. This gives you a quick overview of the current workload or active discussions.

## Creating a new issue report

Once you're on the **Issues** page, you're ready to start drafting your new report. GitHub provides a straightforward form to capture the essential details of your issue.

### Step 1: Initiate a new issue

On the **Issues** page, look for a prominent green button labeled **New issue** located in the upper-right corner of the content area. This button is your gateway to creating a fresh report.

Click the **New issue** button. Clicking this button will navigate you to the "Create new issue" form. This form is designed to collect all the necessary information about your problem or request.

![Issues tab with New issue button visible](https://d14xczjzvlshjn.cloudfront.net/screencasts/scrcst_sogn5rsrbbimwv3v/processed/article_images/article-article_sld9bbclftir55nz-6-cfddec61-a538-4cec-bcd1-6e2e569df9e2.jpg?Expires=1798124255&Signature=BYx5dxC1-4JjJLIexCAraJxUWDCf1daK0PbFKYhgwqrrO1ANkyKXt2fuYEAt1kIvAWLIf8qUN7vh4JSMtLyJvR1-fMUxdkqEKUPyjj7Y3AZ5f6W91Fh0vrJPsjbjvkIhCf4Wu1e645LT0VXtzm-0uLOV84ePsXQmTs7BIjaTNEYx2LjSIGXbUBYS3RJNqZXi8XXHFR33lB2BxPnMZSr2uID5mezcvhdxKYE4ufdVpP9vrqhu4Ti2Z9-WSyO8SRBqBrFW1nkiDj2HzBV3B8pwFR0h1yzFZ97aLyXk9ErgSZ11zwzuiiOYCknJhBUpTnjqRTuVmfk~FbjXAuzlhqAGsA__&Key-Pair-Id=APKA26BID7YIZU7LYRQT)

> [!TIP]
> Before creating a new issue, it's often helpful to search existing issues to see if someone else has already reported the same problem. This prevents duplicate reports and helps maintain a cleaner issue backlog.

### Step 2: Input the issue title

The "Create new issue" form requires a title. A good title is concise, descriptive, and immediately conveys the core of the issue.

Locate the **Add a title** field, which is marked with an asterisk indicating it's a required field. The placeholder text in this field reads "Title". Type a clear and descriptive title for your issue. For example, if a part of a website isn't functioning as expected, you might type: _website header not working_.

![Issue title field with example text \"website header not working\"](https://d14xczjzvlshjn.cloudfront.net/screencasts/scrcst_sogn5rsrbbimwv3v/processed/article_images/article-article_sld9bbclftir55nz-12-1abf217c-9a07-4493-8178-4884cdcc588e.jpg?Expires=1798124255&Signature=LtgkfSH4Xd6WahZ3UTFLV-o~RDvwr8CHjquY68KX9Y7n-Uks3mn~849WG8XHUU6nzV7va8saYCV8-0AisLqA-uVJ1vwT8Xzgg59a3tclg85qjZC7aCXmu-3Daz9vY17epd1fduc1Mglyzf0KI7Y9Lz2kpi9esF6qrCnYyPNzE7HQ2Xj6CSNMrzExOuLgvCyemuZhVqqQrth31MSgAqOV8QphKE2e64pt6daTBY~s9CII4hshfJYFv0hM9lVdixmNYZ4EgACsnplkwPQ9gGXg3bJnPPovXbFsZs10Q5f8kbkCbCn0DDtrodyU3YNZlWhDItpRx4ciuMyx0Z82RbrUPQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKA26BID7YIZU7LYRQT)

> [!TIP]
> Best practice: Keep your issue titles brief (under 70 characters) but informative. It should be enough for someone to understand the problem at a glance.

### Step 3: Provide a detailed description

While the title summarizes the problem, the description is where you provide all the necessary context and details for maintainers to understand and reproduce the issue. A good description typically includes steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and actual behavior.

Below the title field, find the **Add a description** section. This area contains a large text area with the placeholder "Type your description here...". This description field supports Markdown for rich text formatting. Click inside the description text area.

![Issue description text area highlighted for input](https://d14xczjzvlshjn.cloudfront.net/screencasts/scrcst_sogn5rsrbbimwv3v/processed/article_images/article-article_sld9bbclftir55nz-13-7fd08757-ff32-4646-ac4c-731747c1fb0e.jpg?Expires=1798124255&Signature=Row7TSm5vcx6vS86-hfqXEcBmgHzEBKMQ5FESoOVhBTqCFxItlZNepWlWHpiIY-tbJBLPy3LnUNXiUMMZsxZaB5fotZELXfgHyKd4kEKMhEZQ~4m9rnTkCBYQUyyKGuuU5mUHNUXG61Czgmlejdtja2-D4H-oq2S9a-nPqpQRD84M-GTiWTQVQr7-39oBJcfgiDUBLgV7~4shmvRS21GNP2fXrB6xVjkVh1YCrDI38oQjURS3yV489SO47YDfZNvzkIhp1vaYCGXTVURSQ8gxXxXxNeji57PIN2D6yXlnCi86b58yFMbhhE40zOR3ajq93bfYk48402meHgzh5sc-w__&Key-Pair-Id=APKA26BID7YIZU7LYRQT)

Type a comprehensive description of the issue. Include:

- **Steps to reproduce:** A numbered list of actions that consistently trigger the problem.
- **Expected behavior:** What you anticipated would happen.
- **Actual behavior:** What actually occurred, including any error messages.
- **Environment details:** (Optional, but helpful) Browser, operating system, version of the application, etc.

For instance, continuing with the header example, you could type: _creating a new website header fails with 505 error._

> [!NOTE]
> The description area offers "Write" and "Preview" tabs. Use the **Preview** tab to see how your Markdown-formatted description will render before submission. This helps ensure clarity and readability.

## Submitting your issue

After you've provided both a title and a detailed description, your issue is ready for submission. The "Create new issue" form also includes options for assigning the issue, adding labels, linking to projects, or setting a milestone. While these are not strictly necessary for basic issue submission, they are useful for project organization.

> [!NOTE]
> You can assign the issue, add labels, link it to projects, or set a milestone from the form. These options help maintainers triage and organize work but are optional for creating a basic issue.

### Step 1: Submit the issue

At the bottom-right of the "Create new issue" form, you'll see two buttons: **Cancel** and **Create issue**. The **Create issue** button is green and typically enabled once the title field is populated.

Click the **Create issue** button.
